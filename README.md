## Git workflow

![Git Work flow](https://github.com/MaxReimblad/Group-Four/blob/main/imgs/GitWorkFlow.png?raw=true)

- We are builting a branch which is named as dev. On the Dev Branch, we try to develop different features of the application.

### Challenges of Git -- avoiding conflict

When several people work on git, the merge conflicts frequently appear. In order to address these problems, firstly, we need to check the status.

``` git status ```

We use git log to look for which commit is the last correct commit and reset into this commit.

``` git log ```

``` git reset ${the last correct commut} ```

When we accomplish all feature, we are supposed to move on the CI-CD test. If the application passes the CI-CD test, we can merge all features into the main branch.
